# mitempr


Read data from Bluetooth environmental sensors in BTHome v2, PVVX and LYWSDCGQ formats.
Strongly inspired by  [Mitemperature2](https://github.com/JsBergbau/MiTemperature2)  and only here for learning a bit of Rust.

## Status

 - nicely cross compiles to armv6 (Pi Zero W), armv7 (Pi Zero W 2)

## TODOs

 - reads **unencrypted** data only at the moment
 - URL callback to Prometheus Push Gateway
 - call external callback scripts
 - define sensors in a config file & filter defined sensors
 - add flags and options to binary
 - and many more stuff to fiddle with ;-)
